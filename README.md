  This is our game Climate Courier.  To play the game you use the direction keys to move, up being jump, and the spacebar is used as the interact button. To play the game you need to host the index.html file on a webserver.  If you have python installed on your computer you can use the included pyhost shell script to host the index file on a simple html server.
  In this game so far we have implemented the fire particle system as well as basic mechanics.  We will soon have a much more complex terrain, but for the initial prototype it was not able to be included due to merge conflicts. 
The prototype is mainly supposed to show all the mechanics.  The bottom diamond in the tutorial is pushable with the action button down and the diamond above will kill you if you touch it.  That doesn't really make sense, but we will change that when we have more art to work with.

Update:
  Our game now has a mostly finished tutorial and level1. The terrain has been updated to the final version and their are now some puzzles in the game.  Water traps have been added and a climbing mechanic has been added.  The tutorial will explain all of the mechanics of the game.
