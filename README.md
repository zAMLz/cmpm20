  This is our game Climate Courier.  To play the game you use the direction keys to move, up being jump, and the spacebar is used as the interact button. To play the game you need to host the index.html file on a webserver.  If you have python installed on your computer you can use the included pyhost shell script to host the index file on a simple html server.
  In this game so far we have implemented the fire particle system as well as basic mechanics.  We will soon have a much more complex terrain, but for the initial prototype it was not able to be included due to merge conflicts.
